     <!-- The most complex element in SVG. The following commands are available for path data:
      M = moveto
      L = lineto
      H = horizontal lineto
      V = vertical lineto
      C = curveto
      S = smooth curveto
      Q = quadratic Bézier curve
      T = smooth quadratic Bézier curveto
      A = elliptical Arc
      Z = closepath

      Note: All of the commands above can also be expressed with lower letters. Capital letters means absolutely positioned, lower cases means relatively positioned.
